# Lab 01 Basics
This exercise was my first real taste of pure Jave. While it definitely is in the same flavor as C# it already has its own distinctions. The first comes with compiling and running the code. The command `javac` has to be run to first compile the code before `java` allows the specified file to be run.

In the Main file there are a few functions that allowed me to write my first Java. First, `pluralize` adds an 's' to the end of a word if an associated number is zero or greater than one. Next, `flipNheads` flips an imaginary coin using a random number generator and it tracks how many total attempts it takes to get land "heads up" in a row a specified number of times. Lastly, `clock` prints the current time to the console every second and keeps track of a rough estimate of how fast the computer is cycling based on the amount of times it loops through the function.
