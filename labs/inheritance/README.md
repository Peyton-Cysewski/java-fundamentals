## Lab 06 | Restaurants and Reviews
- Restaurants are objects that have a `name`, a `star` rating, and a `price` level.
- Reviews are objects that have an `author`, a `star` review, and a `body` of the review.
- Both objects have a `toString` override method that cleanly output the object and its related methods.
- Reviews can be added to Restaurants using the Restaurant's `addReview` method.
